## Roku SDK

This is the public repo of the mParticle Roku SDK. mParticle's mission is straightforward: make it really easy to use all of the great services in the app ecosystem. Our SDKs and platform are designed to be your abstraction layer and data hub, and we do the work of integrating with each individual app service so you don't have to.

The mParticle platform supports 150+ partners in the ecosystem, including developer tools, analytics, attribution, marketing automation, and advertising services. We also have a powerful audience engine that sits atop our platform to let you action on all of your data - [learn more here](https://www.mparticle.com)!
